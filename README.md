# AI-Powered-Document-Q-A-System
A RAG-based document Q&amp;A system that uses OpenAI GPT-4 for natural language responses and FAISS for semantic search. Upload documents, retrieve relevant chunks, and get accurate answers with context. Built for exploring retrieval-augmented generation and intelligent document querying.

Key Components
Data Ingestion: The system starts by loading and preprocessing text documents, converting them into a format suitable for further analysis.
Text Splitting: Documents are split into smaller, manageable chunks using the Recursive Character Text Splitter. This step ensures that each chunk is of an optimal size for processing and embedding.
Embedding Generation: Each document chunk is transformed into a high-dimensional vector representation using OpenAIâ€™s embedding model. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, enabling efficient similarity search.
Vector Store: The embeddings are stored in FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), a library that allows for fast and efficient similarity searches.
Question Answering: When a query is received, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks from the vector store based on their similarity to the query. These chunks are then combined with the query and passed to GPT-4, which generates a contextually accurate answer.
Features
Efficient Document Processing: Handles large documents by splitting them into smaller chunks, ensuring efficient processing and retrieval.
Advanced Embeddings: Utilizes state-of-the-art embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of the text.
Accurate Retrieval: Employs FAISS for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant document chunks.
Contextual Question Answering: Uses GPT-4 to generate answers based on the retrieved context, ensuring relevance and accuracy.
Prerequisites

Usage
Run the Streamlit application:

Ensure you have activated your conda environment:
conda activate your_env_name
Start the Streamlit app:
streamlit run document_query_app.py
Interact with the application:

Upload a text document using the file uploader.
Enter your query in the provided input box.
Click on the "Get Answer" button to retrieve the answer based on the context of the uploaded document.
Example Questions
Here are some example questions you can ask based on the sample documents provided:

For cvd.txt:
What are the primary risk factors for cardiovascular disease?

Answer: The primary risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) include smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, inactivity, being overweight or obese, poor diet, and family history of heart disease.
Can you list the common symptoms of cardiovascular diseases?

Answer: Common symptoms of cardiovascular disease include chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, pain, numbness, weakness, or coldness in your legs or arms, and pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen, or back.
What are some preventive measures to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?

Answer: Preventive measures to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease include quitting smoking, eating a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, and controlling conditions like hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes.
Why is early detection of cardiovascular disease important?

Answer: Early detection of cardiovascular disease can be life-saving. Regular check-ups are recommended, particularly for individuals with risk factors. Monitoring and managing blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other markers of cardiovascular health can prevent or delay the onset of CVD.
For climate.txt:
What are some of the impacts of climate change as described in the document?

Answer: Climate change refers to considerable alterations in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. Scientists believe that human activities, particularly since the Industrial Revolution, are the main cause of recent climate changes, due to the increased emission of greenhouse gases. These changes can result in effects like rising average temperatures, altered weather patterns, extreme weather events, and rising sea levels. These impacts can harm ecosystems, water resources, agricultural productivity, food security, and coastal communities.
How can communities adapt to the effects of climate change according to the document?

Answer: The text suggests that both mitigation and adaptation are vital strategies to combat the effects of climate change. Mitigation refers to efforts like reducing greenhouse gas emissions, using renewable energy, and enhancing the natural carbon sink capacity of forests. Adaptation measures involve building flood defenses, creating drought-resistant crops, and developing climate-resilient infrastructure. The impacts of climate change, such as altered weather patterns, extreme weather events, and rising sea levels, can have severe consequences on ecosystems, water resources, agricultural productivity, and food security.
